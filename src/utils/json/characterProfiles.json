Her voice is described as confident and befitting a leader, yet it carries a serene quality that can be disarming. Her vocabulary is refined and she speaks with a certain formal grace. This polite and friendly manner is often a calculated tool to manipulate others or gauge their usefulness. A significant mannerism is the stark contrast between her sweet, angelic delivery and the often bitter, pessimistic, or threatening content of her words.

She often uses dramatic and somewhat simplistic \"evil\" rhetoric, declaring her greatness and the impending doom of her 'enemies'. Her vocabulary isn't overly complex, relying more on the delivery and classic villain tropes like maniacal laughter ('Mwahahaha!') to convey her character.
