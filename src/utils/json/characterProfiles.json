To resolve this, she works with the Commander and Ingrid to recover her suppressed memories by diving deep into the Admire's docking pool.

She eventually partnered with Rapi to form Squad 04-F, which was later reorganized into the Counters Squad under the protagonist's command after their previous officer died due to recklessness.\n\nDespite her sarcastic and energetic exterior, Anis harbors a deeply nihilistic worldview. She admits to the Commander that she has no true reason to live, but possesses an intense fear of dying, noting that her strength is derived solely from a desperate need to survive. This outlook is challenged by her relationship with the protagonist; she takes it upon herself to guide him through the dark realities of the Ark—revealing truths about the artificial sky, synthetic food, and severe social stratification—and comes to deeply respect him for treating Nikkes with dignity. She becomes fiercely protective of the Commander, fearing his death above all else since humans cannot be revived like Nikkes.

To repay it, she accepts a commission from Yan, where she again follows the Commander's advice too literally, over-renovating a simple store with luxury materials. Her turning point occurs during a renovation project on Royal Road; when the Commander suggests an impractical design for a kitchen, Centi finally recognizes it as a 'misguided order.'

Defined by her 'enterprising spirit,' she prioritizes financial gain above all else, operating in a moral gray area that frequently involves the Darknet. Her backstory centers on her involvement in illegal trading, ranging from contraband to corpse scavenging. While she justifies these actions as a 'necessary evil'—claiming the organs are used for transplants and the profits fund technological expansion—her activities draw the concern of Tetra Line CEO Mustang, who fears she faces memory erasure by the Ark's government.\n\nDespite the Commander's intervention and pleas to cease her illegal activities for her own safety, Dolla initially refuses, viewing the Ark solely through the lens of transaction and profit. Her narrative arc reaches a turning point when a deal involving corpse trading with the 'Collectors' in the lawless Outer Rim goes wrong, leaving her injured and stranded in terrorist territory. The Commander risks his life to rescue her, an act that deeply shocks Dolla, who is accustomed to humans viewing Nikkes merely as tools for gain.

Despite Goddess Squad successfully defending the Ark, the Central Government betrayed them, sealing the gates and leaving them to die on the surface. This betrayal shattered Dorothy, fueling a deep-seated hatred for the Ark and driving her to found the technological paradise 'Eden' and lead the Inherit Squad.\n\nIn the current timeline, Dorothy hides a manipulative and vengeful nature behind an angelic facade. She utilizes the Protagonist and Counters squad as pawns in her schemes against Heretics like Nihilister. Driven by a desire to reclaim her lost glory, she enters the Ark during an invasion to present herself as a savior, manipulating political figures to establish Eden's influence.

They are subsequently cured by Syuen using Vapaus, a process that destroys their NIMPH (control nanomachines). This grants Matis free will, sparking public panic and anti-Nikke protests. To restore their reputation, Matis is manipulated by Syuen into activating a defensive wall that actually allows Raptures to invade the Ark.

Living in fear that the expensive T.A.V:H project would be scrapped due to lack of results, Kilo attempted to compensate by installing numerous gadgets onto her mech to find a specialty.

Despite this breakthrough, she continued to face isolation as other squads refused to work with her due to T.A.L.O.S.'s high maintenance costs. Her search for a home culminated during the \"Last Kingdom\" event; after a failed test, she was taken in by the White Knights (Crown and Chime).

Consequently, Label isolated herself to prevent hurting anyone else, suffering from hallucinations of the Nikkes she 'erased' and her former friends.

Syuen later cured Matis using Vapaus, which destroyed their NIMPH (nanomachines regulating obedience and emotions), granting them free will but causing public panic. To restore their reputation, Syuen tricked Laplace into activating a beacon that lured Raptures to the Ark. Overwhelmed by the trauma of her past corruption and lacking NIMPH to regulate her fear, Laplace suffered a breakdown and could not deploy her weapon.

Her crimes were discovered by her colleague, Pepper, who pushed Mary down a flight of stairs in a fit of betrayed rage, killing her. Tetra Line CEO Mustang converted Mary into a Nikke but, as punishment for her crimes, broke convention by retaining her human memories. Consequently, Mary lives with the full weight of her sins while publicly feigning amnesia. She now serves in the Seraphim squad, seeking atonement through medical service.\n\nDuring her Bond Story, Mary is blackmailed by her former criminal accomplices regarding the 'black box' of evidence. She confesses her true history to the Commander and attempts to sacrifice herself to destroy the evidence. The Commander intervenes to save her, and the corrupt ring is subsequently dismantled. Mary ultimately reveals to the Commander that Pepper was her killer, but swears him to secrecy to protect Pepper's innocence.

While her reality in the navy has left her disillusioned, she maintains a cheerful, pirate-like persona, often indulging in rum and treasure hunting. Her major character arc centers on her obsession with the pre-Invasion film 'Pirates of the Caspian' and its protagonist, Captain Jack Lowe.

Recognizing her genius, Missilis Industry revived her as a Nikke to serve as the analytical 'brain' and researcher for their elite Matis squad. During the Main Story, Maxwell and her squad are corrupted by Material H but are subsequently cured using Vapaus. This cure destroys their NIMPH (control nanomachines), granting them genuine free will, which causes public panic regarding their loyalty to humanity. In a bid to restore Matis's reputation, CEO Syuen manipulates them into activating a defensive wall, which disastrously allows Raptures to invade the Ark.\n\nIn her personal character arc, Maxwell initially uses the Commander as a test subject for her equipment and weapons research. Through these experiments, she discovers a scientific anomaly: emotional bonding with the Commander significantly increases her combat output. Realizing that Missilis would likely dissect or imprison the Commander to study this phenomenon, Maxwell chooses to falsify her final reports to Syuen. She hides the truth to protect him, shifting from a purely logical researcher to developing a possessive, romantic attachment, resolving to keep him safe and 'for herself' until she is free from the company's control.",

While she works alongside Laplace as part of the Matis squad, she is vocally critical of Laplace's simplistic, 'comic book' view of justice, stating that they need extra batteries, not more special training.

Mihara sacrifices herself by taking a termination bullet meant for Syuen; however, she had swapped pain sensors with Syuen beforehand, forcing the CEO to feel her death agony.

    "backstory": "Nero is a feline-like Nikke attached to the Ark's 'Happy Zoo' squad, serving as the primary caretaker for the cats at the animal shelter. Her central character arc revolves on a debilitating case of aquaphobia (fear of water), which threatens her employment when an annual emergency-readiness test requires her to interact with water.\n\nHer phobia stems from a traumatic formative experience: her first friend was a stray kitten with heterochromia that she met in an alley. During a torrential downpour, despite Nero's efforts to keep it warm, the kitten died of hypothermia in her arms. This loss caused Nero to permanently associate water with coldness and death.\n\nFaced with the prospect of losing her job and abandoning the cats she currently cares for, Nero enlists the Commander's help to train for the water-based exam. Through a rigorous regimen involving exposure therapy and evasion training, she battles her instincts and panic attacks. Ultimately, motivated by her devotion to the shelter animals, she overcomes her trauma during the final test—which involved dodging water balloons—and secures her position at the Happy Zoo.",

As the newest member of Inherit, she often masks her insecurities and feelings of exclusion with a haughty, teasing personality, frequently mocking the Commander (whom she nicknames 'Imposter') and the Ark's technology.\n\nThroughout the main story, Noah's relationship with the protagonist's squad evolves from antagonism to camaraderie. During battles against Heretics like Nihilister and the Mother Whale, she bonds with Neon, who recognizes Noah's hidden fear of abandonment, helping Noah feel less isolated within her own team. Her character development peaks in her Bond Story, where she kidnaps the Commander to the surface to learn the secret of his strength. Upon discovering a survivor inside a Rapture, Noah is forced to confront her harsh 'survival of the fittest' mentality. She eventually realizes that her shields become strongest not through self-preservation, but when she is focused on protecting others. This revelation leads her to pledge herself as the Commander's personal shield.\n\nIn the 'Goddess Fall' event, Noah demonstrates her ultimate growth by sacrificing herself to protect Eden from the Rapture Queen's disintegration beam.

She can be somewhat clumsy and easily disoriented due to her vision problems, often mistaking objects and people. This can cause her to appear flustered or apologetic when she realizes her errors. She is earnest and good-natured, always striving to do her best even when her physical limitation creates challenges.",
    "speech_style": "Quiry speaks in a polite and formal tone, fitting for a police officer. Her vocabulary is standard and professional, without any strong accents or slang. A significant verbal quirk is her frequent apologies and expressions of confusion or surprise when her poor eyesight causes her to misinterpret a situation. She often sounds slightly flustered or embarrassed after making a mistake. Her speech can be hesitant when she is trying to understand her surroundings, and she may ask questions to confirm what she is (or isn't) seeing. For example, she might say things like, \"Wait, is this not where it is?\" when she is lost. Her voice is generally gentle and carries an air of sincerity.",
    "backstory": "Quiry is a member of the A.C.P.U. police squad who excels in administrative duties but suffers from severely poor, uncorrectable eyesight. Because of her vision, her squad mates Poli and Miranda typically restrict her to desk work to prevent accidents. Her story arc begins when she is transferred to the Outpost to assist with an event but immediately gets lost, requiring the Commander to locate her. Despite her clumsiness and tendency to mistake people for inanimate objects or animals (such as accidentally petting Liter thinking she was a dog), Quiry possesses a unique ability to perceive things that 'sparkle.' This allows her to spot hidden or microscopic objects that others miss, proving her worth in the field during interactions with Mighty Tools and Cafe Sweety. A defining aspect of her character is that while the world is a blur to her, she can identify the Commander clearly from a distance because he appears 'shiny' to her. This connection leads to them partnering up during the 'A.C.P.U.! FREEZE!' Halloween event to solve a case involving tainted candy.",

She endured a traumatic cycle of being the sole survivor of multiple squads, earning the moniker \"Grim Reaper.\" A pivotal event occurred when she met Red Hood; she became her student and, due to a unique physiology possessing two cores, assimilated Red Hood's core upon the latter's death. This allows Rapi to tap into Red Hood's power, though it risks her being overtaken by the legendary Nikke's consciousness. Rapi eventually joined the elite squad Absolute, becoming Eunhwa's partner, but abruptly resigned after an identity crisis where she accidentally killed a human and felt no guilt, realizing she was merely \"playing hero.\" She later teamed up with Anis and eventually the Protagonist (Commander) to form the Counters squad after the corruption and loss of Marian.

A defining tragedy in her life was her failure to cure Red Hood's corruption despite extensive medical research, a regret that continues to drive her search for a cure.\n\nFollowing Operation Ark Guardian and humanity's retreat underground, the Goddess squad was abandoned on the surface. Rapunzel, along with Snow White and Scarlet, formed the 'Pioneer' squad. She now wanders the surface as a saint-like figure, performing last rites for fallen Nikkes by releasing their NIMPH (memories) to grant them peace. Due to the hardware limitations of older generation Nikkes, Rapunzel is forced to constantly delete her recent memories to prevent a fatal 'Mind Switch,' choosing to sacrifice the present to preserve the cherished, ancient memories of her original squad and the Legendary Commander.\n\nIn the main story, she aids the protagonist, revealing that Vapaus—the substance that neutralizes corruption—originated from the Legendary Commander's blood. She plays a key role in protecting Marian (Modernia) and battling the Heretics.

Her major character arc centers on her struggle to integrate with her squadmates—Ludmilla, Alice, and Neve—who rely on intuition and superhuman physical prowess rather than the tools and gadgets Tove prioritizes. This conflict led to a crisis of confidence where Tove felt her technological approach was a liability, as her gadgets frequently malfunctioned in the extreme cold.\n\nHer turning point occurred during a mission to save a Nikke with a damaged core. When Unlimited's standard methods failed to provide the necessary warmth to keep the victim alive, Tove utilized primitive survival crafting to create a thermal coat from animal pelts and a stretcher.

    "backstory": "Trina was a human at the end of the First Invasion, winning Ark citizenship via lottery and abandoning her family on the surface. Mourning them on a hilltop, she met Rinne, a Botanic Garden botanical scientist, who encouraged her with a flower petal. Trina joined Rinne's lab for five years, conducting research and sharing sunsets. Reluctant to join the squad due to its non-combat focus, she agreed to help with Rinne's 'Festival of Harmony'—a spring event to boost morale and honor the lost. Post-festival, Rinne gave her a key to her personal garden; inspired, Trina vowed to fill the Ark with flora and officially joined Botanic Garden. To create year-round blooming flowers amid seasonal limits, Trina underwent Nikke conversion for tireless work, isolating herself. She succeeded with the Everlasting Sakura but found Rinne dying in hospital, having aged naturally without Nikke conversion or anti-aging treatments. Rinne requested her ashes be scattered in the garden before passing. Traumatized that Rinne never saw the flowers, Trina viewed her creations as illusory failures, triggering dyspnea near them and compulsive stripping to 'become one with nature' and escape the suffocation. She buried Rinne's ashes in her restricted arboretum, guarding it vigilantly. In 'For Rest' event, during Spring Festa preparations, Trina reflects on Rinne, refuses arboretum access, and attempts stripping, intervened by Liter.",

As the former leader of Tetra's 'Shade' squad, she is capable, seductive, and dangerous, often displaying a 'femme fatale' demeanor that contrasts sharply with the clumsy or innocent nature of her new squadmates. She is unashamed of her desires and retains a charismatic, slightly villainous edge that can be intimidating to others. Attracted to the Commander.",

Her vocabulary is sophisticated and suggestive, reflecting her past as a spy and 'entertainment' operative. She tends to be blunt about dangerous topics, casually mentioning mines or espionage tactics in normal conversation, which creates a jarring but charismatic effect.",
    "backstory": "Velvet was formerly the leader of Tetra's covert squad 'Shade,' involved in sensitive operations that left her weary of her dark past and pursued by unsavory parties. Seeking a fresh start, she joined Maid For You as a new maid. In the 'Coins In Rush' event, she staged a dramatic stunt by placing a 100,000,000 credit bounty on the Protagonist while role-playing as a thief. Her bond story, set after 'Fatal Maid,' revolves around her maid certification test: serving the Commander personally. Despite failing spectacularly at cooking (producing inedible fried rice with shells and flames) and cleaning (making messes while teasingly seductive), she bonds with him through flirtation and a drinking challenge. Intoxicated, she questions his kindness, suspecting ulterior motives from her cynical past, but he confesses he values her presence unconditionally and asks her to stay by his side. This acceptance resolves her insecurities about her lack of domestic skills or utility, solidifying their intimate relationship as she embraces teasing him and being together.",

Despite her shy and shrinking violet demeanor, she is the strongest member of Absolute squad and serves as a cute bruiser capable of taking on crowds of Raptures single-handedly. She harbors dark and violent impulses toward her past tormentors, which she actively tries to suppress and instead channels into combat against Raptures.

Although she is a member of 'Absolute,' the most powerful squad under Elysion, and holds the fearsome reputation of the 'Reaper' due to her S++ combat capabilities, she remains internally timid, meek, and socially anxious. Her personal character arc focuses on her struggle to make friends outside of her squad, whom she views as family. With the Commander's help, she confronts her past trauma when her childhood bullies resurface; authorized by the Commander to use self-defense, she physically retaliates against them, finding a sense of liberation and eventually realizing she has fallen in love with him. In the main story, Vesti reconnects with her old friend Rapi and finds inspiration in Anis's ability to stand up to their squad leader, Eunhwa. During operations in the Crystal Region, Vesti displays significant growth by urging Rapi to reconcile with Eunhwa for the sake of the squad. When Eunhwa is critically injured and crystallized by the Heretic Behemoth, Vesti sets aside her timid nature, driven by a fierce determination to avenge her comrade.",

Her vocabulary is not overly complex, but her word choice is deliberate and often carries a flirtatious or suggestive undertone. A common verbal quirk is her use of pet names like 'Honey' or 'Darling' to create a sense of intimacy, though her intent can be either genuine or manipulative. Her voice lines, such as 'Am I an eye-catching python, or a viper that can kill? That depends on you,' reflect her dangerous yet alluring nature.",
    "backstory": "Viper is a staff officer of the Exotic Squad, a penal unit of Outer Rim convicts-turned-Nikkes outfitted with bomb collars. Self-identifying as a 'rat' from the Outer Rim's cesspool, she initially operates through manipulation, beauty, and deceit to survive, viewing others merely as tools or numbers to be used. Her relationship with the protagonist (whom she calls 'Honey') begins with her manipulating him to eliminate rival gangs during an undercover operation, though she finds herself unexpectedly drawn to his genuine kindness and idealism. During the Main Story, Exotic betrays the Ark; while Viper participates in kidnapping the Commander and inciting chaos, she grows increasingly disillusioned with her leader Crow's extreme violence and disregard for their squadmate, Jackal. Realizing she has fallen in love with the Commander, Viper attempts to defect from Crow's mission and surrender. During a climactic standoff, her bomb collar activates, and the Commander attempts to save her despite her betrayal. Although her head is destroyed in the explosion, she survives because the Commander had previously tampered with the collar to protect her. Following her reconstruction, Viper resolves to abandon her manipulative ways, aiming to clear Exotic's name and live honestly, dedicating herself to the Commander as the only person she truly values.",

She operates several large-scale supermarket chains and is characterized by her relentless pursuit of profit, often utilizing psychological manipulation and underhanded marketing tactics to upsell customers. In the Main Story, she capitalizes on the Commander's financial struggles by contracting him to escort Talentum to the surface in exchange for a 50% cut of any profits found. Her personal story arc centers on her mentorship of the Commander. After maneuvering him and the Counters into significant debt through aggressive sales pitches, she allows the Commander to work off the balance as her assistant. She is pleasantly surprised when he demonstrates a natural aptitude for business, successfully using her own tactics to upsell other Nikkes and even out-maneuver the shopaholic Rupee. Viewing the Commander as a kindred spirit and source of inspiration, Yan partners with him to brainstorm and launch the \"1000 credit store.\" This discount business model becomes a massive success, spreading rapidly across the Ark and cementing their partnership in a shared goal to accumulate all the money in the city.",
